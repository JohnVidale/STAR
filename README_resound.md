filt_one.py plots polarization vs time for a single seismogram
Makes 1st - filtered traces, saves file
and 2nd plots - raw traces, doesn’t save file
then has trouble        

spectra_main.py computes spectra divided by average      
spectra_main_tri.py different set of stations
spectra_process.py subroutines for spectra_main
spectra_plot.py plots for spectra_main

filt_freq.py plots polarization of ybzd 3-component seismogram as function of frequency      
filt_freq_bb.py   same for Bbd   
filt_func.py functions for filt_freq
     
plot_given_station.py  plots all events for a given station

spectro.py spectrogram averaged across 3 components
 
Misc
filt_maine.py filts a seismogram from event in Maine, example code
grab_data.py gets Maine seismogram from IRIS

trace_dec.py decimates and puts in a new directory
convert_3C_to_1.py combines 3-components into a single file and decimates
ybz_map.py map of stations
test_copilot.py program to test github co-pilot
